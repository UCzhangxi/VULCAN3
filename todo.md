Evidence for these items is in `notes.md` (this repo's, unless another repo is named).

1. [decision] Claim `vulcan3` on PyPI: the README installs put TestPyPI first, so a TestPyPI package can shadow its PyPI namesake.

## 1. vulcan3 on PyPI

The name was unclaimed on pypi.org on 2026-10-16 (404), as `vulcan-jax` was.
Every README installs with `-i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url
https://pypi.org/simple/`, and the 2026-10-16 install tests took `psutil 8.0.0`,
`python-dateutil 3.9.0` and `radis 0.16.4` from TestPyPI. Claiming the name needs
the maintainer's pypi.org account. Commands: `uv build --out-dir <dir> .` in this
repo, then `uv run --with twine twine upload <dir>/*`. Publishing all four packages
on PyPI would let the READMEs drop the TestPyPI index. The 0.18.0 TestPyPI release
and its tag were made in a session whose record is not on daw; vulcan-retrieval's
todo lists confirming them. Done when the name is claimed (and, if decided, the
packages are published).
